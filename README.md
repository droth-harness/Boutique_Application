This repo combines the boutique application, helm guestbook, apache Kafka, and other services to highlight most of the Harness capabilities
Mapping: 
- Apache Kafka -> Test Intelligene: This application is extremely large. Without Harness TI, Builds can take several hours. With Harness, Builds take a a couple of minutes.
- Boutique Application -> Multi-service deployment
- Helm Guestbook -> GitOps

--------------------------------

SEs to further elaborate and restructure this repo.
IDP and other solutions exist in the platform demo (it has not been migrated to Gitness yet)
